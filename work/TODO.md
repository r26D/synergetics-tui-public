- [ ] **Add action to jump to a page number**  
       In the TUI (Elixir and/or Ink), add a command or mode to jump directly to a page number (e.g. page 50 of the card list) in addition to the existing jump-to-card-by-id/number.

- [ ] **TUI card list: SHIFT+Arrow to change letter_group**  
       In the TUI card list, add an action to go to the next letter_group using SHIFT + Right Arrow and to the previous letter_group using SHIFT + Left Arrow.
